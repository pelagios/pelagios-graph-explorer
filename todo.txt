TODO...

- Documentation for the REST API
- Documentation for the internal graph model
- Personal graph needs some layout tweaking (datasets should stay closer to places)
- Add 3rd party JavaScript licences + credits 
- Add sample data
- Back button in detail view to return to dataset view...
- Allow searches to be passed via the URL query string
- Clean up the unit tests 
- Add HTTP scripts for harvesting Ptolemy Machine place data 
- JavaScript "graph" and "personal graph"
  - Renaming badly needed...
  - Both now contain lots of duplicate code - should be refactored
    to one common base class
  - Ideally, all JavaScript should REALLY be ported to GWT (along with
    Springy!)
