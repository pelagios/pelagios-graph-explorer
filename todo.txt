TODO...

- Data View!
- On first access, page loading can take a while -> enable AJAX load spinner
- Map/Graph synchronization is still very incomplete in both views
- Add some basic stats (total datasets, total GeoAnnotations, total places,...) to the title bar
- Documentation for the REST API
- Documentation for the internal graph model
- Add 3rd party JavaScript licences + credits 
- Add sample data
- Clean up the unit tests 
- Add HTTP scripts for harvesting Ptolemy Machine place data 
- JavaScript "graph" and "personal graph"
  - Renaming badly needed...
  - Both now contain lots of duplicate code - should be refactored
    to one common base class
  - Ideally, all JavaScript should REALLY be ported to GWT (along with
    Springy!)
- In general: JavaScript refactoring if there's time!!!
