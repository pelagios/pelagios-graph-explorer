TODO
====

- Document JSONP support in the Wiki
- Document getPlace (/places/{uri}) HTTP API method in the Wiki
- Document ?search= and ?pleiadesID= URL parameters in the Wiki 
- JavaScript overhaul, code review, refactoring badly needed!
- Several bugfixes (mouseover/click behavior etc.) still needed in the JS
- Revise readme.txt
- Add a sample database for download ('quick start DB')
- The shortest-path feature needs an overhaul - make it more robust & flexible (see code comments)
- Clean up the unit tests 
- Add HTTP scripts for harvesting Ptolemy Machine place data 
- For the future, we should REALLY consider porting the client side code to GWT (along with Springy!)
- Ptolemy Machine data is not aligned with Pleiades (and therefore not imported at the moment) - find
  a way to deal with this.
- Introduce unique machine-readable identifiers for datasets (URIs)
- There are various smaller TODOs in the code -> check those
