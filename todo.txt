TODO...

- Add some basic stats (total datasets, total GeoAnnotations, total places,...) to the title bar
- Documentation for the REST API
- Add 3rd party JavaScript licences + credits 
- Add sample data
- Clean up the unit tests 
- Add HTTP scripts for harvesting Ptolemy Machine place data 
- JavaScript refactoring/renaming badly needed...
- For the future, we should REALLY consider porting the client side code to GWT (along with Springy!)
- The shortest-path feature needs a full overhaul to make it more robust & flexible
- Ptolemy Machine data is not aligned with Pleiades (and therefore not imported at the moment) - find
  a way to deal with this.
- Introduce unique machine-readable identifiers for datasets (URIs)
